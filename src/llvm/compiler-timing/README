To build pass (from top level directory):
  ./scripts/pass_build.sh compiler-timing CompilerTiming.cpp

To build kernel and apply compiler-timing (from top level directory):
  make clean ; rm nautilus.bc nautilus.ll ; make -j ; make bitcode ; make timing ; make final ; make isoimage

NOTE --- kernel compilation must use WLLVM
NOTE --- to debug the final bitcode: make strip ;
